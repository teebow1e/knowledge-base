## Introduction

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It allows developers to track changes in their mutual codebase over time, facilitating collaboration among team members without the risk of conflicting edits. Furthermore, Git ensures code integrity and provides a safety net by allowing users to revert to previous states in case of errors or unforeseen issues. Its decentralized nature enables developers to work offline and then synchronize changes with a central repository, which ensures flexibility and adaptability.

Having known these advantages, it's necessary for a developer to have a strong understanding of how Git works and how to effectively collaborate with others. That's also the reason why I wrote this guides.

This guide also cover some in-depth topics related to GitHub, ranging from navigating in GitHub, setting up the SSH keys, pushing, cloning and signing commits, just to name a few.
